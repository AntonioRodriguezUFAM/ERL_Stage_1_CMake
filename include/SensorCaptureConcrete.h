//To implement the "System Capture/Loader" and "System Characterization" steps based on the provided diagram, we will follow these steps :


//1. Define the System Capture / Loader Interface and Concrete Class
//This part of the system is responsible for capturing the data from the setup componentsand loading it into the system for further processing.
