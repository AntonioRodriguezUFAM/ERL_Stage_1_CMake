Explanation:
System Capture/Loader:

The ISensorCapture interface defines methods for capturing and loading data from various system sensors.
The SensorCaptureConcrete class implements these methods, simulating the process of capturing sensor data and loading it into the system.
System Characterization:

The ISystemCharacterization interface defines a method for characterizing the system based on the captured data.
The SystemCharacterizationConcrete class implements this method, where the characterization logic is executed.
Continuous Execution:

The runSystem function repeatedly calls the capture, load, and characterize methods in an infinite loop.
These operations are performed concurrently with the run methods of the other components (SoC, Algorithm, Data, etc.), allowing continuous monitoring and system characterization.
Threading:

The components are executed in their own threads, allowing them to operate concurrently.
The capture and characterization steps are integrated within the loop to simulate real-time monitoring.
Considerations:
Real-Time Constraints: Depending on the actual implementation and system requirements, you might need to manage thread priorities, synchronization, and real-time constraints more carefully.
Graceful Shutdown: You may want to implement a signal or mechanism to gracefully stop the infinite loop, allowing the system to clean up resources before shutting down.


Certainly! Let's walk through each step of the Factory Method pattern implementation in detail. 
I'll provide a full description, the objectives, and address the missing input for user definitions that will be used to select the system configuration.

### Step 1: Define Interfaces for Each Component

**Objective**:  
The goal of this step is to establish a set of abstract interfaces for each major component of the system. 
These interfaces serve as contracts that define what functionalities each component must provide, without specifying how these functionalities will be implemented. By doing this, we decouple the code that uses these components from the code that implements them, making the system more flexible and easier to extend or modify.

**Description**:  
Interfaces are pure abstract classes in C++ (classes with only pure virtual functions). For this system, you would define interfaces for each of the key components: SoC, Algorithm, Data, Optimization, Constraints, and Historical Data. Each interface will have a `setup()` function (or other relevant functions) that must be implemented by any class that derives from this interface.

**Example**:  
Here’s an interface for the SoC component:

```cpp
class ISoC {
public:
    virtual ~ISoC() {}
    virtual void setup() = 0;
};
```

Similar interfaces will be created for Algorithm, Data, Optimization, Constraints, and Historical Data.

### Step 2: Define Concrete Implementations for Each Component

**Objective**:  
The objective of this step is to provide specific implementations of the components that fulfill the contracts defined by the interfaces. 
These implementations contain the actual logic and functionality that will be executed when the components are used in the system.

**Description**:  
Concrete classes inherit from the interfaces defined in Step 1 and provide specific functionality in the `setup()` (or other) methods. 
These classes will vary depending on the requirements and might be designed to work with different hardware configurations, algorithms, data sources, etc. Each concrete class will override the methods defined in the interface to implement the desired behavior.

**Example**:  
Here’s how you might implement a concrete class for the SoC component:

```cpp
class SoCConcrete : public ISoC {
public:
    void setup() override {
        std::cout << "Setting up SoC" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

This pattern will be repeated for all other components like Algorithm, Data, etc.

### Step 3: Define a Factory Interface

**Objective**:  
The objective of this step is to create an abstract factory interface that will be responsible for producing instances of the different components. 
The factory interface defines methods for creating each type of component, but it does not specify how these components will be created.

**Description**:  
The factory interface provides a consistent way to create instances of the different components. 
This interface will have factory methods like `createSoC()`, `createAlgorithm()`, `createData()`, and so on. Each of these methods returns a pointer to the corresponding interface. By using a factory interface, the client code does not need to know about the specific classes that implement the components; it only needs to interact with the factory.

**Example**:

```cpp
class IComponentFactory {
public:
    virtual ~IComponentFactory() {}
    virtual ISoC* createSoC() = 0;
    virtual IAlgorithm* createAlgorithm() = 0;
    virtual IData* createData() = 0;
    virtual IOptimization* createOptimization() = 0;
    virtual IConstraints* createConstraints() = 0;
    virtual IHistoricalData* createHistoricalData() = 0;
};
```

### Step 4: Define a Concrete Factory

**Objective**:  
The objective of this step is to implement the factory interface from Step 3. The concrete factory class will know how to create the specific instances of each component (e.g., which concrete `SoC` class to instantiate). 
This step ties together the abstraction provided by the factory interface and the concrete implementations of the components.

**Description**:  
The concrete factory class implements the factory interface by providing definitions for the factory methods. 
Each method creates an instance of a concrete class that implements the corresponding interface. This allows the client code to request an instance of a component without needing to know which concrete class will be used.

**Example**:

```cpp
class ConcreteComponentFactory : public IComponentFactory {
public:
    ISoC* createSoC() override {
        return new SoCConcrete();
    }
    IAlgorithm* createAlgorithm() override {
        return new AlgorithmConcrete();
    }
    IData* createData() override {
        // Return an instance of the concrete Data class
    }
    IOptimization* createOptimization() override {
        // Return an instance of the concrete Optimization class
    }
    IConstraints* createConstraints() override {
        // Return an instance of the concrete Constraints class
    }
    IHistoricalData* createHistoricalData() override {
        // Return an instance of the concrete HistoricalData class
    }
};
```

### Step 5: Use the Factory in Your Main Application

**Objective**:  
The goal of this step is to utilize the factory to create and set up the system's components based on user-defined inputs. 
This step demonstrates how the factory method pattern enables flexibility and modularity in assembling the system from interchangeable parts.

**Description**:  
In your main application, you would instantiate a concrete factory and use it to create all the necessary components. 
The factory is responsible for deciding which concrete classes to instantiate. After creating the components, the application can invoke their `setup()` (or other) methods to configure them.

**Example**:

```cpp
int main() {
    ConcreteComponentFactory factory;

    ISoC* soc = factory.createSoC();
    IAlgorithm* algorithm = factory.createAlgorithm();
    IData* data = factory.createData();
    IOptimization* optimization = factory.createOptimization();
    IConstraints* constraints = factory.createConstraints();
    IHistoricalData* historicalData = factory.createHistoricalData();

    soc->setup();
    algorithm->setup();
    data->setup();
    optimization->setup();
    constraints->setup();
    historicalData->setup();

    // Continue with the system capture/loader and characterization as per your architecture

    // Clean up memory
    delete soc;
    delete algorithm;
    delete data;
    delete optimization;
    delete constraints;
    delete historicalData;

    return 0;
}
```

### Input User Definition for System Configuration

**Objective**:  
Allow the user to define which specific configuration to use for the system (e.g., different SoC types, algorithms, etc.). 
This input will be used to select the appropriate concrete implementations dynamically.

**Implementation**:

- The user can provide input (e.g., via command line arguments, configuration files, or a UI) to select the desired configuration.
- Based on the user input, the system will instantiate the appropriate concrete factory, which will then produce the corresponding components.

**Example**:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    std::string config = argv[1]; // User-defined configuration (e.g., "high_performance")

    IComponentFactory* factory;

    if (config == "high_performance") {
        factory = new HighPerformanceFactory();
    } else if (config == "energy_saving") {
        factory = new EnergySavingFactory();
    } else {
        factory = new DefaultFactory();
    }

    ISoC* soc = factory->createSoC();
    IAlgorithm* algorithm = factory->createAlgorithm();
    IData* data = factory->createData();
    IOptimization* optimization = factory->createOptimization();
    IConstraints* constraints = factory->createConstraints();
    IHistoricalData* historicalData = factory->createHistoricalData();

    soc->setup();
    algorithm->setup();
    data->setup();
    optimization->setup();
    constraints->setup();
    historicalData->setup();

    // Clean up memory
    delete soc;
    delete algorithm;
    delete data;
    delete optimization;
    delete constraints;
    delete historicalData;
    delete factory;

    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion

This pattern allows for a highly modular and flexible system where components can be easily swapped or extended without affecting other parts of the system. 
By using the Factory Method pattern, you can easily adapt to different hardware configurations, algorithms, and optimization strategies, making your system both scalable and maintainable.
